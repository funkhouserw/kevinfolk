<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Marx.jpg" 
title="Karl Marx Wordmark
<br><br>This mark was my solution to a project for STA 365, Typography 1: Form and Meaning. The problem was to create a wordmark which represented the assigned word. This was addressed in the Marx mark by means of abstracting commonly identifiable communist symbols, and working them into custom lettering which features a harsh and repetitive diagonal movement.">

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Ares.jpg" 
title="Ares Letterform
<br><br>This piece was created for STA 460: Graphic Design II: Visual Communication. The assigned project was to select a mythological god, and then create a visual representation by altering the first letter of the god’s name in such a way as to create a one-color letterform. In this work, Ares, the god of war, was selected. His traditional spear and bronze-shield are integrated into the form of the A.">

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/CRI.jpg"
title="CRI Logo
<br><br>This logo form was completed for STA 494: Design Center. The Client was Crystallographic Resources, Inc, a company who identifies and structurally analyzes organic and non-organic crystals for pharmaceutical companies and research groups. This one-color mark was created to form a synthesis between the ideas of “crystal” and “molecule” and imbue a sense of structure and order. This mark was of my original design and was perfected with the help of a group of students who I directed. This work was featured in the 2010 BFA Graphic Design Exhibition and Student Show at Michigan State University."><img src="images/thumbs/CRI.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="CRI Logo"/></a></li>

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Icer.jpg" 
title="Icer Logo
<br><br>This logo form was completed for STA 494: Design Center. The mark was designed for the Institute for Cyber Enabled Research. ICER is a technology group which distributes computing time to help with research projects. This mark was of my original design and was perfected with the help of a group of students who I directed. The logo communicates the idea of interconnectivity through the repetition of the “node” form as well as through the implied shape left by the four nodes.

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Ambulance.jpg" 
title="Ambulances for the Ample Magazine Spread
<br><br>This piece was created for STA 460: Graphic Design II: Visual Communication.  I chose a minimal approach in my use of image and text, opting to create a graphic symbol to visually represent the message of the article, which focused on the ethical question of charging obese people more for ambulances and medical treatments. I reduced the article to a minimal amount of necessary text, and allowed the graphic symbol and body text to interact with a large field of charged white space. This work was featured in the 2010 Student Show at Michigan State University.">

<li class="thumb"><a class="group" rel="earth" href="images/portfolio_images/Earth1.jpg" 
title="Earth Magazine Cover
<br><br>This cover spread is a part of a project for STA 365: Typography 1: Form and Meaning. The project required the redesign of a selected magazine, from which I gathered the article content and tone. All photographic content for the magazine was shot by me in the local area. The magazine spreads adhered to a unified system of text treatment, color, and grid. I opted for a narrow color scheme, using primarily black, white, and cyan, for a clean and modern feel.">
<img src="images/thumbs/Earth.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="Earth Magazine"/></a></li>

<a class="group" rel="earth" href="images/portfolio_images/Earth2.jpg" 
title="Earth Table of Contents
<br><br>This Table of Contents spread was used as an opportunity to adhere less strictly to the established grid, and instead have more inventive and playful typography. In this spread, the color and text systems can be seen carried through from the cover spread.">
</a>

<a class="group" rel="earth" href="images/portfolio_images/Earth3.jpg" 
title="Earth Spread
<br><br>This content spread was designed to showcase an article about expanding and improving the national power grid to be more efficient and safer. The assignment called for a synthesis of image and text. I chose and photographed the subject to represent the degradation of our nations current power grid.">
</a>

<li class="thumb"><a class="group" rel="catch" href="images/portfolio_images/Catch_22_Detail.jpg" 
title="Catch 22 Cover Detail
<br><br>The dust jacket seen here was created for STA 463: Book Design. The project was to find a used book and create for it a dust jacket which addressed the original information content of the covers and represented the story in a new way, both visually and through tone. I chose Heller’s classic Catch-22.">
<img src="images/thumbs/Catch_22.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="Catch 22 Cover"/></a></li>

<a class="group" rel="catch" href="images/portfolio_images/Catch_22.jpg" 
title="Catch 22 Cover
<br><br>The repetition of bomber silhouettes in formation is used to reinforce the ideas of bureaucracy and uniformity addressed in the text. The lone bright-red plane represents Yossarian, constantly at odds with the war. The dust jacket was printed on heavyweight yellowed drawing paper, giving it a worn look and texture.">
</a>

<a class="group" rel="catch" href="images/portfolio_images/Catch_22_Full.jpg" 
title="Catch 22 Cover
<br><br>The interior flaps feature a short biography of Heller and oblique allusions to parts of the story.">
</a>

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/UURAF.jpg" 
title="UURAF Flyer
<br><br>This work is a promotional piece created for Michigan State University’s Undergraduate Office, for their yearly University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum. The UURAF is a university-wide interdisciplinary event which provides students engaged in research an opportunity to share their findings. This piece was used promotionally, in newspaper advertisements, and invitations, as well as on the cover of the event book.  I chose a fractal form in order to address the ideas of growth and the metaphor of knowledge as a tree.">
<img src="images/thumbs/UURAF.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="UURAF Flyer"/></a></li>
 
<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Self_Portrait.jpg" 
title="Graphic Self Portrait
<br><br>This piece was my final project for STA 360: Graphic Deisgn 1: Graphic Form. The assignment was to create a poster which addressed graphic design and ourselves. I chose to do a self-portrait. I set several different weights and point sizes of Univers to created an approximate self portrait. The text was taken from an essay by Paul Rand on the subject of commercial design. The contradiction addressed in the essay is reinforced by the assertion “I don’t want to sell you anything”.">
<img src="images/thumbs/Self_Portrait.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="Graphic Self Portrait"/></a></li>

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Pinocchio.jpg" 
title="Pinocchio Book Cover
<br><br>This piece was created for STA 460: Graphic Design II: Visual Communication. The project was to create a front cover which represents a traditional children's story using allusion or visual metaphor. I chose Carlo Collodi’s original version of Pinocchio, in which the character is eventually hung to death by bandits after not heeding the advice of his elders. This much darker tone is echoed by the stark symbol of the noose hanging from what one assumes to be Pinocchio’s nose.">
<img src="images/thumbs/Pinocchio.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="Pinocchio Book Cover"/></a></li>

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Hamlet.jpg" 
title="Hamlet Play Poster
<br><br>This-poster (22 x 28 inches) was created for STA 460: Graphic Design II: Visual Communication. The assignment was to create a promotional piece for a performance of a Shakespearean play. I chose to work with Shakespeare’s classic work, Hamlet. Here, the playing card is used to address the issue of duality and existentialism, as the figures of death and the king weave together as one. This piece was featured in the American Advertising Federation’s 2010 Mid-Michigan Student Addy Awards, and won a Silver Addy in the category of collateral material.">

<li class="thumb"><a class="single_image" href="images/portfolio_images/Botany.jpg" 
title="Arts and Crafts Poster
<br><br>This poster was created for MSU's UAB annual Arts & Crafts Show. In designing this poster I began with the ideas of the natural elements of spring and handmade items. This lead to imagery from the old 18th and 19th century style of illustrating botanical texts. The custom aged-parchment background texture, limited organic color palette and gothic type choices add to the visual experience that the poster is a page ripped from an antique botanical text."><img src="images/thumbs/Botany.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="Arts and Crafts Poster"/></a></li>

All of the frames were drawn by hand, with pencil on paper, and then layered with an acrylic-stained acetate transparency to provide the background coloration.
